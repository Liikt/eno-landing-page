                <h1>Get around the resort.</h1>
                    The resort is marvellous! Come and take a tour at the different places that can be discovered here. We call these places VMs. 
                    No questions, please. Here, we want to introduce you to the Vulnbox VM.
                <h2>Vulnbox</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the most important VM and the one on which your part of the game will take place. You'll get a bunch of
                    services that you need to defend and find security vulnerabilities to attack other teams. You can find
                    the IP address of your team on the <a href="/network.html"> network tab</a>.
                    The Vulnbox can bei either <strong> hosted by yourself </strong> or <strong> provided to you by us</strong>. 
                    See the instructions below for further details.
                </p>

                <h3>Vulnbox - Service Interaction</h3>
                <p>
                    The services run in their own docker container and are started via docker-compose.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Vulnbox provisioning</h3>
		<p>You will be able to start your vulnbox yourself when the ctf starts.</p>
		<p>Navigate to the Vulnbox tab and hit "create" (this will do nothing before the start of the ctf). The vulnbox will get created and the initial root password and your vulnbox ip will be displayed.</p>
		<p>After you have logged onto the vulnbox you can grab the openvpn config (/root/client.conf) and distribute it to all players of your team to connect to the competition.</p>
                    
                <h4>Bring your own</h4>
                    <p>You don't want us to host the vulnbox? Then feel free to bring your own gear.</p>
		    <p>Please have a look at the steps above as you also have to spin up your vulnbox to get all required config files and the services</p>
                        <h4>VPN using Wireguard</h4>
                        <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/">Installation Guide</a>
                        <p>You need to download the configuration file from the provided vulnbox. The config will be in:</p>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <code>/etc/wireguard/game.conf</code>
                        </div>

                        <p>Before you can spin up your own wireguard interface you need to change the endpoint in the configuration, so that your <code>game.conf</code> looks something like this:</p>

                        <div class="code-block">
                            <code>[Interface]
                            PrivateKey = &lt;your privatekey&gt;
                            Address = 10.0.0.&lt; teamID &gt;/32

                            [Peer]
                            PublicKey = &lt;gamerouters publickey&gt;
                            Endpoint = vpn.bambi.ovh:51820
                            AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/16
                            PersistentKeepalive = 15
                            </code>
                        </div>

                        <p>Now you need to down the wireguard interface on the provided vulnbox. You can do this using the following command:</p>
                        <div class="code-block"><code>wg-quick down game</code></div>

                        <p>Now you can use this configuration to start your wireguard interface.</p>
			<h4>Services</h4>
			<p>In order to get the services on your own hardware, you can either copy them from the vulnbox, or download it from a git repo which we will publish when the ctf starts.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
